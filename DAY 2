Serial Communication-> 8 bit data  transfer one bit at time 
parallel Communication -> 8 bit data transfer at the same time


  LSB -> Lest significant bit
  MSB -> Most Significant bit

  serial communication method:

      Synchronous -> data tranismited with clock
      Asynchronous -> 
  UART:
        It's serial Communication
        It is also Synchronous or AschronousReciver or Tranismited
        UART is a Full Duplex
    Duplex:
        Data can be tranismited and recived
    Simplex:
        Data can be tranismited only or recived only
    Half Duplex:
        Data can transimited in only one way at a time
    Full Duplex:
        Data can both(transimited or recived) way at a time
