Introduction of ARM:
        The ARM microcontroller stands for Advance RISC Machine; 
it is one of the extensive and most licensed processor cores in the world. 
The first ARM processor was developed in the year 1978 by Cambridge University, 
and the first ARM RISC processor was produced by the Acorn Group of Computers in the year 1985.

This article covers the below mentioned components.


ARM processor family:
       ARM has designed a number of processors that are grouped into different families according to the core they use. 
       The families are based on ARM7, ARM9, ARM10 and ARM11 cores. 
       The postfix numbers 7, 9, 10 and 11 indicate different core designs. 
       The ascending number equates to increase in performance and sophistication.

ARM Micro Architecture:
       The ARM architecture contains a programme counter (PC) register and 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15). 
       The registers of ARM microcontrollers can operate in a number of different ways: User mode: 
       In this setting, the CPU runs typical user programmes. Registers R0-R12 are accessible in user mode.
