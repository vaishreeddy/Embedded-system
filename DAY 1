CPU-only know Addition
Basics:
RAM-Primary memory storage
secondary storage(hardware)->Non-volatile Memory
Clock->Heart beat of CPU
RAM-2 Types
                  S-RAM : FlipFlop(made of) Static
                  D-RAM: capacitors(made of) Dynamic
ARM:
             Cortex  A->Application
                  Cortex  R->Real time Application
                  Cortex  M->Microcontroller(Process only)

1.Static RAM is faster than Dynamic Ram
BUS -> used to communicate between CPU up Computer ( Median)
Pheripherals :-
                        GPIO => To communicate environment
                                   => These are sent by ‘System Bus’ (s bus)

AHB1=>180MHZ(Maximum)
it is two types
1. AHB/APB2-> 90MHZ(Maximum)
2.AHB/APBI-> 45MHZ(Maximum
