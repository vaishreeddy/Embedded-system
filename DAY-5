PROCESS CREATION
         1) System ()  - Library Function
         2) Fork ()  -  System Call
         3) Wait() -  System Call
         4) Exec() -   System Call
         5) waitpid() - System call
         6) Clone()  - All system call clone function
         
FORK1
/*
*  A hello world program on fork, note the parent executes first, then the shell and then the child
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
   int cpid = fork();
   if (cpid == 0)
       printf("Hello I am child\n");
   else
       printf("Hello I am parent\n");
   return 0;
}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

         PID of the child process returned the parent and 0 is returned in the child
         Once the fork has been called child process has been created

      output:

Hello I am parent
Hello I am child
